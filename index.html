						# Representational State Transfer
						## More commonly known as `Rest`
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## What is Rest?
						* REST is a common standard in which web Application Programming Interfaces(API)
						and web User Interfaces(UI) are designed
						* REST allows developers to build their API and UI in such a way, so that it may
						lend itself to rapid development and scalability
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## Rapid Development?? Scalability??
						* Rapid development allows you to spend more time designing new
							features, as well as deploying those new feature
						* In software, deployment is the act of placing your finished product on a server or
							virtual machine where the application is destined to be run and
							accessed by end users
						* Scalability simply means you can enable few or many users, or in some cases other applications,
							to access your application. It can `scale` up or down as needed
					</script>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## How does rest do all this?
							* The main concept of `REST` is to design your application to use what are known as
								standard HTTP methods.
							 * A Method is a piece of software which performs a specified function
							* The methods most commonly used in `REST` are
							 * GET
							 * POST
							 * PUT
							 * DELETE
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## By following standard practices, we alleviate confusion
							* HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol by which servers and browers
								talk to one another.
							* It is used as a backbone to the place that we call the internet today
							* It has been refined to enable performance based on the methods used for communication
							* When designing an API or UI, by following RESTful practices, you set yourself
								up for success by defining what are known as routes using the proper HTTP method
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Routes??
							* If you have ever browsed to a website, you have used a route.
							* The most common route is `/`, more commonly refered to as slash
							* Think of http://www.facebook.com/ that trailing slash is a route.
							* A route is also referred to as a URL, or URI. It is the way that your browser knows how to submit
								a request to a server via HTTP.
							* A request is defined via the HTTP method which is used.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Requests
							* The HTTP methods referred to earlier are more commonly know as _CRUD_ methods
							* It stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete
							* Think of a request, as if you are asking the web site you are browsing to, to perform some action
							* That action, when defined properly, should have a specific outcome.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## How do requests and HTTP go togeher?
							* Create - or POST, should create something new on the server
							* Read - or GET, should request content which already exists on the server
							* Update - or PUT, should modify an existing piece of content on the server
							* Delete - should remove content from the server
							* These define specific routes, to perform actions on a server
							* By following a standard practice, it allows for consistency and clarity when designing
								an application.
							* By following RESTful design practices, it makes it so that the browser knows exactly how perform every
								task as they were intended.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Common applications of REST
							* When you browse to Facebook, and you post a status update, consider that a POST request
							* When you scroll through your news feed, that is a GET request
							* When you edit your profile, that is a PUT request
							* When you delete a picture or post, that is a DELETE request
							* We define these routes in web applications to perform tasks which are necessary to curate the content
								available on that application
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Rapid Development and Scalability??
							* The other benefit of properly defined REST routes, is that it enables your application to perform Inter-server Communication
							* Think of this, like when you authorize an app on your phone to connect with your Facebook or Twitter account.
							* That application knows how to talk to Twitter and Facebook via a common public api to perform numerous tasks
								on your behalf
							* If you can rely on a separate server for authentication, profile management, content curation, etc. You merely have to leverage
							that, and define your application, and you have now deployed an application with that functionality as well as your own
						</script>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## Consuming RESTful APIs
						* Rest is most commonly used to design APIs
						* An API is not like a User Interface, but rather is designed
							to provide raw content from a provider
						* A few very popular APIs are
						 * Twitter - https://stream.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/sample.json
						 * Facebook - http://graph.facebook.com/
						 * Google - WAAAAAAY too many APIs to cover here
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						An example of a GET request to the Twitter API using NodeJS would look like
						For simplicity sake, I use the twitter NPM module to perform the request
						```
var Twitter = require('twitter');

var client = new Twitter({
	consumer_key: 'WWAlUVHUmZgMUJjrQ4UPgm29y',
	consumer_secret: '[REDACTED]',
	access_token_key: '499440061-0rtjTnHO1kFOeM7dQKm9MOF528jHJJk9ubMDQIMc',
	access_token_secret: '[REDACTED]',
});

var params = {screen_name: 'ESabelhaus'};
client.get('statuses/user_timeline', params, function(error, tweets, response){
	if (!error) {
		console.log(tweets);
	}
});
						```
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## What will this code do?
						* First, it will send a request to twitter, using the provided keys and tokens
						* Once Twitter authorizes my application to be sure I am who I say I am, it will return a response
						* This response from Twitter will be in the form of JSON, and will contain every tweet which I have tweeted, as well as the metadata of each tweet
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## JSON
						* pronounced "Jay-sawn"
						* This stands for Javascript Object Notation
						* JSON is a standard programming notation language used to define the attributes of some object
						* In the case of twitter, the object being defined is a tweet
					</script>
