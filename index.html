						# Representational State Transfer
						## More commonly known as `Rest`
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## What is Rest?
						* REST is a common standard in which web Application Programming Interfaces(API) and web User Interfaces(UI) are designed
						* REST allows developers to build their API and UI in such a way, so that it may lend itself to rapid development and scalability
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## Rapid Development and Scalability
						* Rapid development allows you to spend more time designing new features, as well as deploying those new features
						* Scalability simply means you can enable few or many users, or in some cases other applications, to access your application. It can `scale` up or down as needed
					</script>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## How does rest do all this?
							* The main concept of `REST` is to design your application to use what are known as standard HTTP methods.
							 * A Method is a piece of software which performs a specified function
							* The methods most commonly used in `REST` are
							 * GET
							 * POST
							 * PUT
							 * DELETE
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## By following standard practices, REST alleviates confusion
							* HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol which enables servers and browers transfer digital communications.
							* REST is the practice of designing the routes of your API or UI in a way that represents what action you intend to perform using HTTP
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Routes??
							* The most common route is `/`
							* Think of `http://www.facebook.com/` that trailing slash is a route.
							* A route is part of URL, or URI. It is the way that your browser knows how to submit a request to a server via HTTP.
							* The first part, www.facebook.com, is the domain name of the server
							* The second part, the `/`, tells your browser to GET the content provided at the base route of the server.
							* A request is defined via the HTTP method which is used, in this case GET.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Requests
							* The HTTP methods referred to earlier are more commonly know as _CRUD_ methods
							* It stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete
							* Think of a request like asking the server to perform some action
							* That action, when defined properly, should have a specific outcome
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## How do requests and HTTP go togeher?
							* Create - or POST, should create something new on the server
							* Read - or GET, should request content which already exists on the server
							* Update - or PUT, should modify an existing piece of content on the server
							* Delete - should remove content from the server
							* These define specific routes, to perform actions on a server
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Common applications of REST
							* When you browse to Facebook, and you post a status update, consider that a POST request
							* When you scroll through your news feed, that is a GET request
							* When you edit your profile, that is a PUT request
							* When you delete a picture or post, that is a DELETE request
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## back to Rapid Development and Scalability
							* HTTP enables an application to perform Inter-server Communication
							* Think of this, like when you authorize an app on your phone to connect with your Facebook or Twitter account.
							* That application knows how to talk to Twitter and Facebook via a common public REST api to perform numerous tasks on your behalf
							* If an application can rely on a separate server for authentication, profile management, content curation, etc. You merely have to leverage that as part of its design
							* This cuts down the time from inception to deployable code drastically!
						</script>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## Consuming RESTful APIs
						* Rest is most commonly used to design APIs
						* An API is not like a User Interface, but rather is designed to provide raw content from a provider
						* A few very popular APIs are
						 * Twitter Stream - https://stream.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/sample.json
						 * Facebook Graph - http://graph.facebook.com/
						 * Google Maps - https://www.google.com/maps/embed/v1/place

					<ul>
						<li>This is how a GET request to the Twitter Statuses API using NodeJS would look
						<li>For simplicity sake, I use the twitter Node Package Manager (NPM) module to perform the request.
					<ul>
					<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
var Twitter = require('twitter');

var client = new Twitter({
	consumer_key: 'WWAlUVHUmZgMUJjrQ4UPgm29y',
	consumer_secret: '[REDACTED]',
	access_token_key: '499440061-0rtjTnHO1kFOeM7dQKm9MOF528jHJJk9ubMDQIMc',
	access_token_secret: '[REDACTED]',
});

var params = {screen_name: 'ESabelhaus'};

client.get('statuses/user_timeline', params, function(error, tweets, response){
	if (!error) {
		console.log(tweets);
	}
});
					</pre></code>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## What will this code do?
						* First, it will send a request to twitter, using the provided keys and tokens
						* Once Twitter authorizes my application to be sure I am who I say I am, it will return a response
						* This response from Twitter will be in the form of JSON, and will contain every tweet which I have tweeted, as well as the metadata of each tweet
					</script>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">
						## JSON
						* pronounced "Jay-sawn"
						* This stands for Javascript Object Notation
						* JSON is a standard programming notation language used to define the attributes of some object
						* In the case of twitter, the object being defined is a tweet
					</script>
