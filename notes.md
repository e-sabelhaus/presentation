## What is Rest?

### As the name suggests, it provides a meaningful representation to changes in the state of information transferred to and from an application.

## Rapid Development and Scalability

### By enabling rapid development, you also allow for rapid deployment of your applcation
### This enables teams to get more done in less time

## How does rest do all this?

### These methods, when used properly, allow an application to communicate via HTTP

## By following standard practices, we alleviate confusion.

### It is used as a backbone to the place that we call the internet today
### When designing an API or UI, by following RESTful practices, you set yourself up for success by defining what are known as routes using the proper HTTP method

## Routes??

### Domain names are what tell your computer the IP address of a server

## Requests

### Think of a request, as if you are asking the web site you are browsing to, to perform some action

## How do requests and HTTP go togeher?

### By following a standard practice, it allows for consistency and clarity when designing an application.
### By following RESTful design practices, it makes it so that the browser knows exactly how perform every task as they were intended.

## Common applications of REST

### We define these routes in web applications to perform tasks which are necessary to curate the content	available on that application

## Javascript code snippet

### Explain the auth
### Explain what the module is doing behind the scenes
### Focus on the GET, and what it is doing
